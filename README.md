# DESCRIPTION

Fully-featured ANTLR 3 parser generation for Dart.

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a tool that is used to generate
code for performing a variety of language recognition tasks: lexing, parsing,
abstract syntax tree construction and manipulation, tree structure recognition,
and input translation. The tool operates similarly to other parser generators,
taking in a grammar specification written in the special ANTLR metalanguage and
producing source code that implements the recognition functionality.

While the tool itself is implemented in Java, it has an extensible design that
allows for code generation in other programming languages. To implement an
ANTLR language target, a developer may supply a set of templates written in the
StringTemplate ([http://www.stringtemplate.org](http://www.stringtemplate.org)) language.

This dart lib is a complete implementation of the majority of features
ANTLR provides for other language targets, such as Java and Python. It contains:

* An extended version of the latest ANTLR program, bundling all necessary
  Java code and templates for producing fully featured language recognition
  in Dart code

* A dart runtime library that collects classes used throughout the code that
  ANTLR generates
   
* An antlr3 and an antlrworks jars, used to create the grammars and to generate
  code for performing a variety of language recognition tasks: lexing, parsing,
  abstract syntax tree construction and manipulation, tree structure recognition,
  and input translation.


# HOW TO BUILD
In order to use dartlr you have to create a custom antlr3 build. In contrast to
other languages code generation for Dart isn't part of the standard antlr3 code
repository yet.


## Get antlr3 and build it 
  * Clone it from github

  ```bash
  $> git clone git://github.com/antlr/antlr3.git
  ```

  * Prepare build environment 

  Build relies on maven. If not installed yet, you have to install it first. On Ubuntu do
  ```bash
  $> sudo apt-get install maven
  ```

  * Build antlr

  ```bash
  $> cd antlr 
  $> mvn -N install
  $> mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip=true package assembly:assembly
  ```
  If the third step fails, run it again. 

## Create symbolic links to the files supplied by dartlr

```bash
$> cd antlr3

# /path/to/dartlr is the full path to your local dartlr repository 
$> ln -s /path/to/dartlr/antlr-templates tool/target/classes/org/antlr/codegen/templates/Dart  
$> ln -s /path/to/dartlr/antlr-codegen/DartTarget.java tool/src/main/java/org/antlr/codegen/DartTarget.java
```

## Build again

```bash
$> mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip=true package assembly:assembly 
```    

This should create the file tool/target/antlr-master-{version}-SNAPSHOT-completejar.jar which includes support for
Dart code generation.

## Test it
  * Create a trivial grammar in the file trivial.g

  ```antlr
  lexer grammar trivial;
  options {
    language = Dart;
  }
  ZERO: '0';
  ```
  
  * Run antlr

Make sure that the antlr jar you've built in the previous steps is on the classpath.
 
```bash
$> java org.antlr.Tool trivial.g
```
This should create the files trivial.dart and trivial.tokens.

# USAGE

1. Write an ANTLR grammar specification for a language

   ```antlr
   grammar SomeLanguage;
   
   options {
     language = Dart;    // <- this option must be set to Dart
     output   = AST;
   }
   
   top: expr ( ',' expr )*
     ;
    
   // and so on...
   ```

2. Run the ANTLR tool with the `java -jar path/to/antlr3.jar` command to 
   generate output:
   
   ```bash
   $> java -jar path/to/antlr-3.5.1-with-dart.jar [OPTIONS] lang.g
   # creates:
   #   langParser.dart
   #   langLexer.dart
   #   lang.tokens
   ```
   
   alternatively, you can do:
   
   ```bash 
   $> export CLASSPATH=path/to/antlr-3.5.1-with-dart.jar:$CLASSPATH
   
   $> java org.antlr.Tool [OPTIONS] $grammar
   ```

   NOTES: Probably you will need to edit the `@header{}` section in your grammar. 
   
   Use 
   ```antlr
   @header {
   library your_library_name;
   import "package:dartlr/dartlr.dart";
   }
   ``` 
   if the parser and lexer should be generated in a dedicated Dart library. 
   
   Use 
   ```antlr
   @header {
   part of your_library_name;
   // no import statement here, add it to the parent library file 
   }
   ```
   if the  parser and lexer should be generated as part of another library.
    	
   More samples can be found in the test folder.
	 
3. Make sure your `pubspec.yaml` includes a dependency to `dartlr`

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
   	 dartlr:
   	   git: git@github.com:tiagomazzutti/dartlr.git 	 
   ```	 

4. Try out the results directly:

 ```dart
 import "package:dartlr/dartlr.dart";
 import "SomeLanguageLexer.dart";
 import "SomeLanguageParser.dart";

  main() {
  
    var lexer = new SomeLanguageLexer(charStream);
    var tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
    var parser = new SomeLanguageParser(tokens);
  
    var result = parser.<entry_rule>();    
    // ...
  
  }
  ```
