  /*  Compute the error recovery set for the current rule.  During

   *  enclosing rule. This local follow set only includes tokens
   *  from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
   *  ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
   *
   *  EXAMPLE
   *
   *  When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
   *  consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
   *  thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
   *  can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
   *  You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
   *  input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
   *  rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
   *
   *  Consider grammar:
   *
   *  a : '[' b ']'
   *    | '(' b ')'
   *    ;
   *  b : c '^' INT ;
   *  c : ID
   *    | INT
   *    ;
   *
   *  At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
   *  that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various "local"
   *  follow sets:
   *
   *  FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
   *  FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
   *  FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
   *
   *  Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
   *
   *  a -> b -> c
   *
   *  and, hence, the follow context stack is:
   *
   *  depth  local follow set     after call to rule
   *    0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
   *    1          ']'                     b
   *    3          '^'                     c
   *
   *  Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
   *  been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
   *  included.
   *
   *  For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
   *  (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
   *  all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
   *  could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
   *  resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
   *  we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
   *  sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
   *  In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is in this set so we would
   *  not consume anything and after printing an error rule c would
   *  return normally.  It would not find the required '^' though.
   *  At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
   *  exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
   *  set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
   *  the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
   *  exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
   *  with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
   *
   *  So, you cna see that the parser walks up call chain looking
   *  for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
   *
   *  Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.

  /** Compute the context-sensitive FOLLOW set for current rule.
   *  This is set of token types that can follow a specific rule
   *  reference given a specific call chain.  You get the set of
   *  viable tokens that can possibly come next (lookahead depth 1)
   *  given the current call chain.  Contrast this with the
   *  definition of plain FOLLOW for rule r:
   *
   *   FOLLOW(r)={x | S=>*alpha r beta in G and x in FIRST(beta)}
   *
   *  where x in T* and alpha, beta in V*; T is set of terminals and
   *  V is the set of terminals and nonterminals.  In other words,
   *  FOLLOW(r) is the set of all tokens that can possibly follow
   *  references to r in *any* sentential form (context).  At
   *  runtime, however, we know precisely which context applies as
   *  we have the call chain.  We may compute the exact (rather
   *  than covering superset) set of following tokens.
   *
   *  For example, consider grammar:
   *
   *  stat : ID '=' expr ';'      // FOLLOW(stat)=={EOF}
   *       | "return" expr '.'
   *       ;
   *  expr : atom ('+' atom)* ;   // FOLLOW(expr)=={';','.',')'}
   *  atom : INT                  // FOLLOW(atom)=={'+',')',';','.'}
   *       | '(' expr ')'
   *       ;
   *
   *  The FOLLOW sets are all inclusive whereas context-sensitive
   *  FOLLOW sets are precisely what could follow a rule reference.
   *  For input input "i=(3);", here is the derivation:
   *
   *  stat => ID '=' expr ';'
   *       => ID '=' atom ('+' atom)* ';'
   *       => ID '=' '(' expr ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
   *       => ID '=' '(' atom ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
   *       => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
   *       => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ';'
   *
   *  At the "3" token, you'd have a call chain of
   *
   *    stat -> expr -> atom -> expr -> atom
   *
   *  What can follow that specific nested ref to atom?  Exactly ')'
   *  as you can see by looking at the derivation of this specific
   *  input.  Contrast this with the FOLLOW(atom)={'+',')',';','.'}.
   *
   *  You want the exact viable token set when recovering from a
   *  token mismatch.  Upon token mismatch, if LA(1) is member of
   *  the viable next token set, then you know there is most likely
   *  a missing token in the input stream.  "Insert" one by just not
   *  throwing an exception.
