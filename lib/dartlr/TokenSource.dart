/** A source of tokens must provide a sequence of tokens via nextToken()
 *  and also must reveal it's source of characters; CommonToken's text is
 *  computed from a [CharStream]; it only store indices into the char stream.
 *
 *  Errors from the lexer are never passed to the parser.  Either you want
 *  to keep going or you do not upon token recognition error.  If you do not
 *  want to continue lexing then you do not want to continue parsing.  If you want to continue
 *  lexing then you should not throw an exception to the parser--it has already
 *  requested a token.  Keep lexing until you get a valid one.  Just report
 *  errors and keep going, looking for a valid token.
