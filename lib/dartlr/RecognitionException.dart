/** The root of the ANTLR exception hierarchy.
 *
 *  To avoid English-only error messages and to generally make things
 *  as flexible as possible, these exceptions are not created with strings,
 *  but rather the information necessary to generate an error.  Then
 *  the various reporting methods in Parser and Lexer can be overridden
 *  to generate a localized error message.  For example, MismatchedToken
 *  exceptions are built with the expected token type.
 *  So, don't expect getMessage() to return anything.
 *
 *  ANTLR generates code that throws exceptions upon recognition error and
 *  also generates code to catch these exceptions in each rule.  If you
 *  want to quit upon first error, you can turn off the automatic error
 *  handling mechanism using rulecatch action, but you still need to
 *  override methods mismatch and recoverFromMismatchSet.
 *
 *  In general, the recognition exceptions can track where in a grammar a
 *  problem occurred and/or what was the expected input.  While the parser
 *  knows its state (such as current input symbol and line info) that
 *  state can change before the exception is reported so current token index
 *  is computed and stored at exception time.  From this info, you can
 *  perhaps print an entire line of input not just a single token, for example.
 *  Better to just say the recognizer had a problem and then let the parser
 *  figure out a fancy report.
