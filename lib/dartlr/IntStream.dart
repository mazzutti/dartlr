   *
   *  This is different from rewind in its multi-directional
   *  requirement and in that its argument is strictly an input cursor (index).
   *
   *  For char streams, seeking forward must update the stream state such
   *  as line number.  For seeking backwards, you will be presumably
   *  backtracking using the mark/rewind mechanism that restores state and
   *  so this method does not need to update state when seeking backwards.
   *
   *  Currently, this method is only used for efficient backtracking using
   *  memoization, but in the future it may be used for incremental parsing.
   *
   *  The index is 0..n-1.  A seek to position i means that LA(1) will
   *  return the ith symbol.  So, seeking to 0 means LA(1) will return the
   *  first element in the stream.
